name: Simple Kafka Test
description: Test basic Kafka publishing (requires Kafka running)

setup:
  # Create the test topic first using kafka-topics command
  # This step would normally be done via testcontainers or external setup

steps:
  - wait:
      duration: 1s
      reason: Allow topic to be ready

  # For now, just validate the YAML structure
  # Real Kafka tests require topic creation which needs admin access
