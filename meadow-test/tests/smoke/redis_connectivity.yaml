name: Redis Connectivity Check
description: Verify Redis is accessible and services can use it for caching

steps:
  # Redis is typically used for caching auth tokens and rate limiting
  # We can verify connectivity indirectly through service health checks
  # and by testing features that rely on Redis

  # All services use Redis for various caching purposes
  # Health checks should validate Redis connectivity
  - http_request:
      service: orchid
      method: GET
      path: /api/v1/health
      expect:
        status: 200

  - http_request:
      service: lotus
      method: GET
      path: /api/v1/health
      expect:
        status: 200

  - http_request:
      service: ivy
      method: GET
      path: /api/v1/health
      expect:
        status: 200

  # Note: If services implement detailed health checks that include
  # Redis status, we could add assertions on the response body
  # to verify Redis is specifically reported as healthy
